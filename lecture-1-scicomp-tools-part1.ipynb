    "Very roughly, in PKI, one can create *keypairs* of a matching private and public key. Anyone with the public key can encrypt a message that can only be decrypted with the matching private key. In SSH, this concept is used to provide a much better alternative to passwords. If you have provided an SSH server with your public key, then the server can ask you to decrypt something in order to prove you have the matching private key. Using PKI in this way means that your password does not have to be sent over the network, greatly reducing your attack surface. The security of SSH's PKI can be further enhanced by using a *passphrase* with your private key. Effectively, a private key with a passphrase cannot be used except by someone who knows that passphrase. Critically, this passphrase is **never** sent across the network, but is only used by your local machine to reconstruct the full private key."

The fork can then be cloned like any other repository, or even forked again. This makes it much easier to contribute bug fixes, documentation, new features, etc. to open-source projects. Though a full explanation of forking is beyond the scope of this lecture, we'll briefly summarize here.

This library has support for controlling a very large number of different experimental instruments, but there's always many more out there that could be supported. With traditional version control systems like Subversion, it would be very hard to send a new instrument driver to InstrumentKit for inclusion, but with Git, it is much simpler.

    "- ``git diff`` â€” One of the most powerful Git features is its ability to quickly compare different commits, providing summaries of what changes were made and when. Together with modern text editors and programs like ``rcs-latexdiff``, Git provides rich information about the history of a project. Many Git hosting services, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab, provide ``diff`` information through their respective web interfaces, making it easy to see changes directly online.\n",
    "- ``git checkout`` â€” Though we've seen several uses of ``git checkout`` above, this command is much more powerful than we've explored so far. It can be used to restore individual files, change branches, view old commits, or even commits from other remote repositories.\n",
    "- ``git reset`` â€” If you've ever staged something that you didn't mean to, ``git reset`` can revert the staging area without losing changes. This command is also very powerful, though, and can be used for many other things, such as permanently moving commits between branches.\n",
    "- ``git stash`` â€” If you want to temporarily save changes for making a commit later, ``git stash`` can make a kind of hidden temporary commit called a *stash*. These stashes are great for keeping rough changes out of the way while you push, pull, merge and otherwise juggle commits.\n",
    "- ``git tag`` â€” Tags are very similar to branches, but don't move with new commits, instead permanently identifying individual commits by human-readable names. Most commonly, tags are used to denote particular versions, allowing commands like ``git checkout v1.0`` to work like you'd hope.\n",
    "- ``git cherry-pick`` â€” Cherry picking allows you to select a subset of commits from a different branch, rather than merging the entire thing in at once. This is very useful in breaking merge operations down into more manageable pieces, or for amending other people's pull requests."

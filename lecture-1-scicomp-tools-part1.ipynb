Though this was a useful exercise, it's somewhat limited by one critical problem: we needed to type in our password. This will become very annoying if we have to use SSH as part of an automated process, as will be the case when we learn Git later in this lecture. To solve this, we rely on the *public key infrastructure* (PKI) built into SSH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very roughly, in PKI, one can create *keypairs* of a matching private and public key. Anyone with the public key can encrypt a message that can only be decrypted with the matching private key. In SSH, this concept is used to provide a much better alternative to passwords. If you have provided an SSH server with your public key, then the server can ask you to decrypt something in order to prove you have the matching private key. Using PKI in this way means that your password does not have to be sent over the network, greatly reducing your attack surface. The security of SSH's PKI can be further enhanced by using a *passphrase* with your private key. Effectively, a private key with a passphrase cannot be used except by someone who knows that passphrase. Critically, this passphrase is **never** sent across the network, but is only used by your local machine to reconstruct the full private key."

Indeed, now we need to manage keys *and* type in a far longer string of characters each time we wish to use SSH to do, well, anything. Thankfully, we're not done yet, as we have yet to use an SSH *agent*. An agent is a piece of software running on our local machine that manages SSH keys on our behalf, such that once a key is unlocked by our passphrase, we need not use that passphrase again until the agent decides to lock the key based on its security policy. On macOS / OS X, Keychain acts as an SSH agent and is built into the operating system, such that we should not need to do any further work. Similarly, on Ubuntu, an SSH agent called ``ssh-agent`` is provided by default when we install ``ssh`` using ``apt-get``, as in Lecture 0."

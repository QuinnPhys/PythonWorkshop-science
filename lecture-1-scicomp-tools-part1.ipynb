    "In Lecture 0, we covered the use of the command line, and we installed a variety of packages including SSH and Git (without telling you exactly what they were for). Here comes the punchline: SSH is a cryptographic protocol for communicating over an unsecured network, and Git is software for version control and collaboration. In the first part of this Lecture, we'll show you how to use SSH for secure, remote computing. Then, we'll use SSH together with Git to show how we can really make our lives simpler."

This will become very annoying if we have to use SSH as part of an automated process, as will be the case when we learn Git later in this lecture. To solve this, we rely on the *public key infrastructure* (PKI) built into SSH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very roughly, in PKI, one can create *keypairs* of a matching private and public key. Anyone with the public key can encrypt a message that can only be decrypted with the matching private key. In SSH, this concept is used to provide a much better alternative to passwords. If you have provided an SSH server with your public key, then the server can ask you to decrypt something in order to prove you have the matching private key. Using PKI in this way means that your password does not have to be sent over the network, greatly reducing your attack surface. The security of SSH's PKI can be further enhanced by using a *passphrase* with your private key. Effectively, a private key with a passphrase cannot be used except by someone who knows that passphrase. Critically, this passphrase is **never** sent across the network, but is only used by your local machine to reconstruct the full private key."

For instance, suppose that you make a new commit on your local repository, bringing you to a total of four. In that case, your ``master`` branch moves forward with that commit, but ``origin``'s ``master`` doesn't have that commit and stays in place. Running ``git push`` then makes the new commit available to the server (``origin``) and advances its ``master`` to match our local repository.

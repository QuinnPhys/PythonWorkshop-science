    "In this Lecture, we will use an interactive Python interface called a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) to evaluate Python code. This interface will then help us learn about types, indexing, functions, and classes in Python. We will also discuss the general differences between Python 2 and 3 as well as ways of formatting the code you write to keep you and your collaborators happy. Finally we will setup a Python interface that consists of a notebook with code and documentation cells called *Jupyter Notebook*.\n",

    "        - Having two leading and trailing underscores (```__var_name__```) indicates the name of a special attribute, used by the Python interpreter itself. For instance, ``a.__add__(b)`` is called to resolve ``a + b``. Do not use your own names of this form, but instead only use those defined in the Python documentation."

    "[Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) (formerly IPython Notebooks) are really neat ways to share and run code that can be mixed with rich formatted documentation, notes, pictures, equations in LaTeX, etc. *You might notice that what you are looking at currently is an example of such a notebook* :) The idea is similar to Mathematica in that you have a document that consists of cells that can contain code from a variety of [languages](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages), which links to a *kernel* that can execute the code in the notebook. If you look in the top right corner of this page you can see what kernel is connected to the notebook (probably some version of Python).\n",

Open a new bash or Powershell terminal and navigate on your computer (as discussed in [Lecture 0](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QuinnPhys/PythonWorkshop-science/blob/master/lecture-0-scicomp-tools-part0.ipynb)) to the cloned GitHub repository for this workshop.

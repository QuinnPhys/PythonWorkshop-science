    "Always 4 spaces. Some text editors insert a special character called the tab character whenever you press the tab key (this is represented in Python by \"\\t\"), which show up as any number of spaces. Python 2.x and older versions could understand a tab character mixed with spaces, but Python 3 and later require sticking with either spaces or tabs. If you dont like hitting the space bar 4 times, you can often configure your editor to auto convert between you hitting tab and entering 4 spaces (see [earlier tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QuinnPhys/PythonWorkshop-science/blob/master/lecture-0-scicomp-tools-part0.ipynb) on setting up your editor).\n",

For instance, ``a.__add__(b)`` is called to resolve ``a + b``. Do not use your own names of this form, but instead only use those defined in the Python documentation."

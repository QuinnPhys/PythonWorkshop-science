The EQuS Workshop on Python for Quantum Information Science (EPQIS) is
dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not
tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form. Sexual language and
imagery is not appropriate for any workshop venue, including talks. Workshop
participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
workshop at the discretion of the workshop organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to
  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
  physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following 
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour 

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the
right to take any actions to keep the workshop a welcoming environment for all
participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the
workshop.

Workshop organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with
the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile
for any participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-
related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside
event activities too!

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it
as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce
the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event.
People like you make our event a better place.

You can make a personal report by contacting a workshop organizer.

When taking a personal report, we will ensure you are safe and cannot be
overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed
properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be
upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring
someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't
tell anyone who you are.

Our team will be happy to help you to feel safe for the duration of the event.
We value your attendance.

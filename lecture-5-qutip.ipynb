    "QuTiP is a bit harder to install than other packages we've seen, for one simple reason: compilers. Most of what we've seen thus far has been *pure Python*, meaning that the entire library is interpreted by Python at run time. This can result in very portable and maintainable code, but can come at a performance cost. In some cases, we can pay down that performance cost by relying on the acceleration provided by NumPy and SciPy, or using more advanced tools such as Numba or even TensorFlow. QuTiP takes a different tack, though, and uses *native* code as well as pure Python. Since QuTiP generates this native code at run time, that means it must understand how to interact with compilers. Thankfully, Anaconda helps us out in this regard on Windows, while on Ubuntu and macOS / OS X this is handled by the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by ensuring that we have everything we need in our Anaconda environment. Many of these packages were probably installed in previous Lectures, but that's OK; ``conda`` will let us know if we asked to install something that's already there (this is another benefit of using a package manager, by the bye)."

    "- ``cython``: This is a library used to write code in a kind-of-Python, kind-of-C language, and is very useful for interfacing with native code written in C.\n",
    "- ``nose``: This is a *unit testing library* that will help us ensure that QuTiP works correctly once we have it installed. Not strictly necessary, but pretty helpful.\n",
    "- ``libpython`` (Windows-only): This provides the files needed to compile native code that interacts with Python or Cython. Note that for compatability reasons, we insist on using a version earlier than 2.0.\n",
    "- ``mingw`` (Windows-only): This package provides the *minimal GNU environment for Windows*, a set of compilers used by QuTiP and many other projects to produce native code for Windows. Importantly, Anaconda will install the 64-bit version of MinGW by default. This is really useful, as the 64-bit version is otherwise tricky to install and get working."

That said, it's also a good example of how to install a Python package manually, without using ``pip`` and ``conda``.

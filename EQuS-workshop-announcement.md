EQuS Workshop on Python for Quantum Information Science (EQPIS)

With pleasure we announce the upcoming tutorial workshop, EQPIS, intended to introduce quantum physicists working in both theory and experiment to the Python computing environment*. Additionally, we will cover other computing tools including the command-line interface and the Git version-control environment, which is particularly useful for collaborative science. 

The EQPIS workshop will be jointly held at Macquarie University and the University of Sydney over two days, 17-18 Nov 2016.

Further information, including a detailed schedule and registration information, can be found <here>. Register soon, as we have very limited room for attendance. 

We hope to see you there!

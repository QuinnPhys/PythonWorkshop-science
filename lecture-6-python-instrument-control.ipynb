    "In this lecture we will see how we can use Python to communicate with scientific instruments. First we will look at two packages that help add unit support to Python. Then we will revisit classes and how they can be usefull for desiging Python interfaces to communicate to devices. We will then work on designing a driver for a demo instrument provided in the [git repo](https://github.com/QuinnPhys/PythonWorkshop-science) for this project."

    "Having this inheriting structure for classes makes it easy to share definitions for methods, which can reduce copy/pasting of code and make things more readable. Critically, class inheritance also allows for redefining behavior without having to change how a class is used. In the case of instruments, a base class might represent a particular kind of instrument, such that code using subclasses of that class does not need to know which subclass it is using. We can write code for an entire set of different instruments by abstracting away the *interface* that our code uses to talk to each instrument. This interface is sometimes known as an *application-programming interface*, or *API*, as was [made famous recently](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/reimplementanapi.png). \n",
    "\n",
    "Python lets us represent this process of abstraction with *abstract classes* (sometimes called *abstract base classes*, in an effort to arrive at *ABCs* as an initialism). Unlike the classes we've seen so far, an abstract class is incomplete in the sense that you can't actually make new instances, but instead must make *concrete* subclasses which fill in the missing parts. Thus, an abstract class lets us write the demand that subclasses fill in and completely specify the behavior for a given interface before they can be considered concrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a quick example. In Python, support for ABCs is provided by the ``abc`` package. A class that can be made abstract must have ``abc.ABCMeta`` as its *metaclass*. While metaclasses are fascinating and wonderfully useful, they are also beyond the scope of this workshop, so for now, we'll note that a metaclass lets us add new concepts to the idea of a class itself, rather than to instances of it. Thus, ``ABCMeta`` adds the concept of abstraction to classes. We use the ``future`` package to specify metaclasses, since the syntax for this is different in Python 2 or 3. With that aside, then, our wonderfully compelling and not at all contrived example follows."

All of these templates set up in these packages you could also write yourself, but the question is: \"wouldn't you rather be doing your experiment and not coding?\" Suffice it to say we will now look at how we could use abstract classes from IK to write a driver for our demo instrument.

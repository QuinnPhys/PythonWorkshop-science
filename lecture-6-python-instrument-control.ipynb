    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will see how we can use Python to communicate with scientific instruments. First we will look at two packages that help add unit support to Python. Then we will revisit classes and how they can be usefull for desiging Python interfaces to communicate to devices. We will then work on designing a driver for a demo instrument provided in the [git repo](https://github.com/QuinnPhys/PythonWorkshop-science) for this project."

    "This is cool! Go ahead and try turning the channels on and off in the GUI and see if that is correctly reported by the instrument. At this point, we have a decision point. We could write all of our code by just constructing the strings that are the commands we want to send to the device. Or we could try to something more *generalized*; in that we abstract the communication details specific to this device to a seperate file and just have a generalized interface for other code to use the device. The advantanges to the latter approach mean that if for some reason you need to switch to another device, you can just swap out the specific driver file, or perhaps you need to communicate to another similar instrument and don't want to risk having copies of the same code floating around. \n",

All of these templates set up in these packages you could also write yourself, but the question is: \"wouldn't you rather be doing your experiment and not coding?\" Suffice it to say we will now look at how we could use abstract classes from IK to write a driver for our demo instrument.

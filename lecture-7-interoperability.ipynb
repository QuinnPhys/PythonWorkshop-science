    "Very often, different projects will need to interoperate with each other. Your projects might have to call code ranging from obscure and poorly-documented device drivers and numerical libraries, to legacy projects that depend on \"walled-garden\" style software environments, or even to cutting-edge code in new and exciting scientific computing platforms. Thankfully, Python plays well with others in the sense that a range of tools exist to help make your Python-language projects talk to code written in other languages and for other platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Lecture will be a bit different than the rest, in that we'll not actually do all that much, but rather will briefly review a lot of these interoperability tools. By nature, each of them will come along with a lot of additional baggage (it's hard to use a C-to-Python interface without delving into C, for instance), such that our goal will be to learn what tools are out there. That way, you'll be better equipped to find useful resources when you need to write interoperable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we'll cover interacting with C, MATLAB, and Julia, but we note that many other tools exist. These are only meant to give the \"flavor\" of what tools are available."

    "Many different projects and libraries expose an interface for C-language code, making C a kind of *lingua franca* for computing as a whole. The Python interpreter itself, for instance, is a C-language program, with its own application-binary interface (ABI) for interacting with other C code. The dominance of C for specifying such APIs means that even projects written in other compiled languages like C++, D, or Rust will often expose ABIs as though they were written in C. Thus, chances are pretty good that you'll eventually run across something that you need to call into a C library to use, even if you never plan on using C directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "*NB: you may be familiar with the term \"API\" rather than ABI. This separation reflects the difference between compile-time (API) and linking-time (ABI) interfaces, or alternatively between semantic interfaces (APIs) and low-level interfaces (ABI). At the moment, though, we don't need to worry about this other than to note that ``ctypes`` acts at the level of compiled libraries.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, in recognition of this, Python provides a standard library module ``ctypes`` for loading C-language libraries and calling into them. This is used, for instance, by the [``pyDAQmx`` project](https://github.com/clade/PyDAQmx) to provide a Python-language wrapper for the DAQmx library provided by National Instruments to control their data aquisition (DAQ) devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly, the procedure for using ``ctypes`` to interact with C-language libraries goes in three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the C-language library.\n",
    "- Define the types of the functions exposed by that library.\n",
    "- Call functions using ``ctypes`` objects that wrap C types.\n",

    "Often, the API exposed by a C library is specified in terms of *header files*.

To address this need, [``cffi``](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides a different approach. Instead of direcly constructing function objects which wrap C functions, ``cffi`` will parse a header file and generate a wrapper automatically. For instance, the ``cffi`` documentation suggests the following example to achieve the same as above:"

    "Both of these approaches work dynamically at runtime, using the Python interpreter to manage *dynamic linking*. While this is fine for many tasks, it does come with the downside that using Python to manage dynamic linking is fairly slow. That doesn't matter much for instrument control, which is typically IO-bound rather than CPU-bound, but can matter a lot if the point of working with C is to interact with accelerated libraries. For this, there's not much substitute for writing new code in C that talks both to the library of interest and to the Python interpreter. This new C code will then be linked at compile-time or at run-time as managed by the compiler or operating system dynamic linker, eliminating the overhead of working through the interpreter. This is a painful process, though, such that we'd like a nicer way to generate C code for the purpose of interacting with Python.\n",

Though MATLAB does support writing native C, C++, or FORTRAN code that interacts with the [MEX API](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/introducing-mex-files.html?s_tid=gn_loc_drop), this API is quite unwieldy to work with directly if one wants to interoperate with MATLAB.

Though this is a more advanced feature, it's worth being aware of what environments can do. In particular, environments are a way of managing parallel installations of Python, such that packages can be installed into a particular environment without conflicting with each other. This is a huge benefit for reproducible research, as one can simply distribute a description of what ``pip`` and ``conda`` packages are needed to build an environment. In ``conda``, such descriptions are given by the file ``environment.yml``, while ``pip`` calls it ``requirements.txt``."

    "In the process of learning about scientific computing, we will encounter many examples of using a *command line* to interact with our computing environments. You may be more familiar with a graphical user interface (GUI), where interactions occur primarily by manipulating information in a graphical manner. In contrast, command lines mostly consist of typing text to be read by a special program called a *shell*. In <i class=\"fa fa-linux\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> Linux and <i class=\"fa fa-apple\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> macOS/OS X, one especially common shell is called bash, while PowerShell and cmd.exe are much more common shells on <i class=\"fa fa-windows\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> Windows.\n",

    "In any case, the operational definition of \"fun\" being what it is, Python and the Anaconda distribution each come with their own package managers, called ``pip`` and ``conda`` respectively. The ``conda`` package manager has the advantage of supporting scientific software packages in other languages (currently R and JavaScript) as well as Python, and also has richer support for compiled code. On the other hand, ``pip`` works with Python distributions other than Anaconda, and thus enjoys much wider support. Our strategy moving forward will thus be to prefer ``conda`` packages when they exist, and otherwise use ``pip``."

    "As a final digression for this Lecture, the discussion of the proliferation of package managers aside, ``pip`` and ``conda`` each have a major advantage over system package managers that is quite worth mentioning: *environments*. Though this is a more advanced feature, it's worth being aware of what environments can do. In particular, environments are a way of managing parallel installations of Python, such that packages can be installed into a particular environment without conflicting with each other. This is a huge benefit for reproducible research, as one can simply distribute a description of what ``pip`` and ``conda`` packages are needed to build an environment. In ``conda``, such descriptions are given by the file ``environment.yml``, while ``pip`` calls it ``requirements.txt``."
